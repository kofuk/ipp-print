## TODO

- [ ] Parse collection attributes as a map (or a similar data structure)
- [ ] Implement interface to access parsed data structure
    - It might be good if it has a struct which has each attribute group as member
- [ ] Implement interface to construct data which send to a printer.
- [ ] Send requests like job creation to a printer

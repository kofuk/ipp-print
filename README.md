# IPP

## Current Status

- Send IPP request
- Receive IPP response and parse it to Rust struct
- Print sample URF raster data

## TODO

- [ ] Generate raster data

## About IPP and Driverless Printing

There are some specifications based upon IPP.

- AirPrint: Transfers page data with Apple Raster (image/urf), JPEG, and PDF.
- IPP Everywhere: Transfers page data with PWG Raster, JPEG, and PDF.
- Mopria: Transfers page data with PCLm (raster-only PDF subset), PWG Raster, and PDF.
- Wi-Fi Direct Print Services: Transfers page data with PCLm, PWG Raster, and PDF.

We should be able to get supported format by calling `Get-Printer-Attributes`,
so I expect that driverless printing could be implemented by treating printers
that support these standards as regular IPP devices.
